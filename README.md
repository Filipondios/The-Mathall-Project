# Mathall 2.0.0 Files & Executable .jar

Mathall is a project which is focused on solving algebraic problems such as matrix determinants, solving systems of equations, etc. 

Due to the short time available and the lack of knowledge, this same program is not yet made with graphical interfaces, so Mathall will be available only for terminal.

## How to Run Mathall 2.0.0
For both operating systems described below, there is a common way, which is to open the terminal and only run the following command (ALWAYS FROM THE DIRECTORY THAT THE MATHALL PROJECT IS LOCATED):

java -jar "Mathall/dist/Mathall.jar"

Finally run the given .sh file from the original downloaded project in a terminal with the command ./mathallInit.sh
