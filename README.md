# What is Mathall?

Mathall is a project which is focused on solving algebraic problems such as matrix determinants, solving systems of equations, etc. 

Due to the short time available and the lack of knowledge, this same program is not yet made with graphical interfaces, so Mathall will be available only for terminal for a time.

## What can Mathall 2.2.0 do?

At this version, Mathall can do opetations with matrix and resolution of equations. Here is the list of the exact opetations
that you can do in Mathall 2.2.0:

### Matrices Utils

     <td>Inverse of any square Matrix</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Product of two Matrices</td>
    <td>Rank of any matrix</td>
    <td>Row echelon form of a Matrix</td>
  </tr>

    <td>-</td>
    <td>-</td>
    <td>Transpose of any Matrix.</td>
  </tr>
</table>

### Ecuation/s system/s Utils

## How to Run Mathall 2.2.0
For both operating systems described below, there is a common way, which is to open the terminal and only run the following command (ALWAYS FROM THE DIRECTORY THAT THE MATHALL PROJECT IS LOCATED):

```bash
java -jar "Mathall/dist/Mathall.jar"
```
### Another options:

#### Linux <img align="left" alt="Linux" width="26px" src="https://github.com/devicons/devicon/blob/v2.15.1/icons/linux/linux-original.svg" style="padding-right:10px;" />

Run the given executable file from the original downloaded project in a terminal with the command below:

<pre>
./MathallRun
</pre>

#### Windows <img align="left" alt="Windows" width="26px" src="https://github.com/devicons/devicon/blob/v2.15.1/icons/windows8/windows8-original.svg" style="padding-right:10px;" />

<pre>
Just make a double click in the given .exe file (MathallRun.exe) <br><b>OR</b> click the link with icon (Mathall - Its recomended because gives a better look in the Windows terminal).
</pre>

## Whats new in Mathall?
- Row echelon form of any matrix.
- Inverse of a square matrix.
- Transpose of any matrix.
- New input system: Fractions will be accepted. At this day, Mathall only accepts integer or fraction numbers. 
- Domentation is available now in the folder Mathall/doc. To see all documentation in your browser, open index.html.

## Whats next in Mathall?
- Resolution of any equation system.
- A new package to perform calculations on the euclidean space **(Possibly this update will come in Mathall 3.0.0)**
