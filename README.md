# What is Mathall?

Mathall is a project which is focused on solving algebraic problems such as matrix determinants, solving systems of equations, etc. 

Due to the short time available and the lack of knowledge, this same program is not yet made with graphical interfaces, so Mathall will be available only for terminal for a time.

## What can Mathall 2.2.1 do?

At this version, Mathall can do opetations with matrix and resolution of equations. Here is the list of the exact opetations
that you can do in Mathall 2.2.1:

### Matrices Utils
<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Operations With Matrices</th>
    <th>Matrices properties calculus</th>
    <th>Other Matrix manipulations</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Addition - Difference between two Matrices</td>
    <td>Determinant of any Square Matrix</td>
     <td>Inverse of any square Matrix</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Product of two Matrices</td>
    <td>Rank of any matrix</td>
    <td>Row echelon form of a Matrix</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>-</td>
    <td>-</td>
    <td>Transpose of any Matrix.</td>
  </tr>
</table>

### Ecuation/s system/s Utils

## How to Run Mathall 2.2.1
For both operating systems described below, there is a common way, which is to open the terminal and only run the following command (ALWAYS FROM THE DIRECTORY THAT THE MATHALL PROJECT IS LOCATED):

```bash
java -jar "Mathall/dist/Mathall.jar"
```

<b>Depending of the terminal or the OS, Mathall won't look the same as the photo (It never would be). This picture was taken in a ArchLinux terminal 
with a transparency effect, so the wallpaper is visible and makes Mathall more beautiful than  it is.</b>
  
## Whats new in Mathall?
- Inproved understandig of the program for the user.

<br>

## Whats next in Mathall?
- A new package to perform calculations on the euclidean space **(Possibly this update will come in Mathall 3.0.0)**
