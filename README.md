# What is Mathall?

Mathall is a project which is focused on solving algebraic problems such as matrix determinants, solving systems of equations, etc. 

Due to the short time available and the lack of knowledge, this same program is not yet made with graphical interfaces, so Mathall will be available only for terminal for a time.
